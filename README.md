What is jform?
==============
jform is a form generation engine.

You write your question in the JSON format, and the form will be auto-generated on the page, with the added bonus of client-side validation, error management, answers serialization.

Question types are plugins, making it really easy to implement and register new ones.

You can also extend the core functionnalities using another type of plugin. In the demos, the bootstrap-compatible error display is a plugin (bootstrap.js)

jform is compatible with Bootstrap 3.0 out of the box, and can be adapted to any CSS framework with a really simple code change.

With jform, you will be able to save your forms in your database, and generate forms on the fly. You'll never have to write any HTML ever again to create forms!
