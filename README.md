What is jform?
==============
jform is a form generation engine.

You write your question in the JSON format, and the form will be auto-generated on the page, with the added bonus of client-side validation, error management, answers serialization.

Question types are plugins, making it really easy to implement and register them.

You can also extend the core functionnalities using another type of plugin. In the demos, the bootstrap-compatible error display is a plugin (bootstrap.js)
